# Project 2: Mobile App with Computer Vision

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy computer vision models to mobile applications using TensorFlow Lite and Core ML. We'll create both Android and iOS applications with real-time image classification, object detection, and custom model deployment.

## Objectives
- Convert models to mobile-optimized formats (TFLite, Core ML)
- Implement real-time camera inference on mobile devices
- Optimize models for mobile hardware constraints
- Create cross-platform mobile CV applications
- Handle mobile-specific challenges (memory, battery, latency)
