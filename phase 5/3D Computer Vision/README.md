# 3D Computer Vision

## Overview
Three-dimensional computer vision techniques for understanding depth, shape, and spatial relationships in 3D space. Essential for robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems.

## Concepts :
- Camera calibration and stereo vision
- Structure from Motion (SfM)
- 3D reconstruction techniques
- Point clouds and mesh processing
- Depth estimation from single images
- 3D object detection and pose estimation
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
