# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks are the cornerstone of modern computer vision. This section covers CNN architectures, from basic concepts to advanced designs used in state-of-the-art systems.

## Concepts :
- Convolution operation and filters
- Pooling layers (Max, Average, Global)
- CNN architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet)
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning
- Batch normalization and dropout in CNNs
- Data augmentation strategies
- Model optimization and efficiency

## Projects :
- [Project 1: CNN from Scratch](Project%201/README.md) - Build a CNN without frameworks
- [Project 2: Image Classification with CNNs](Project%202/README.md) - CIFAR-10/ImageNet classification
- [Project 3: Transfer Learning](Project%203/README.md) - Fine-tune pre-trained models
- [Project 4: CNN Architectures Comparison](Project%204/README.md) - Compare different CNN designs
- [Project 5: Custom Dataset Classification](Project%205/README.md) - Build classifier for custom dataset
