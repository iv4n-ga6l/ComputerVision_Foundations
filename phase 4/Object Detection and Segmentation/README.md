# Object Detection and Segmentation

## Overview
Advanced computer vision tasks involving locating and segmenting objects in images. This covers both detection (bounding boxes) and segmentation (pixel-level classification).

## Concepts :
- Object detection frameworks (YOLO, R-CNN, SSD)
- Instance segmentation (Mask R-CNN)
- Semantic segmentation (U-Net, FCN, DeepLab)
- Anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression
- Multi-scale detection and feature pyramids
- Loss functions for detection and segmentation
- Evaluation metrics (mAP, IoU, Dice coefficient)

## Projects :
- [Project 1: YOLO Object Detection](Project%201/README.md) - Implement YOLO for real-time detection
- [Project 2: Semantic Segmentation with U-Net](Project%202/README.md) - Pixel-level classification
- [Project 3: Instance Segmentation](Project%203/README.md) - Detect and segment individual objects
- [Project 4: Custom Object Detector](Project%204/README.md) - Train detector for specific objects
- [Project 5: Video Object Tracking](Project%205/README.md) - Track objects across video frames
