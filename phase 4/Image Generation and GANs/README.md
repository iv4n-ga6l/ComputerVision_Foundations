# Image Generation and GANs

## Overview
Generative models for creating new images, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion models.

## Concepts :
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Diffusion models and denoising
- Generator and discriminator architectures
- Training stability and mode collapse
- Conditional generation and style transfer
- Evaluation metrics for generative models
