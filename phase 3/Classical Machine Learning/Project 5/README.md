# Project 5: Random Forest Texture Classification

Implement texture classification using Random Forest ensemble method with multiple texture descriptors.

## Objective
Classify different textures using ensemble learning methods and comprehensive texture feature extraction.

## Key Concepts

### Random Forest:
- Ensemble of decision trees with bootstrap sampling
- Reduces overfitting through averaging predictions
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Robust to noise and missing data

### Texture Descriptors:
- **LBP (Local Binary Patterns)**: Micro-texture analysis
- **GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**: Spatial relationships
- **Gabor Filters**: Frequency and orientation analysis
- **Wavelet Features**: Multi-scale texture analysis

## Features Implemented
- Multiple texture feature extraction methods
- Feature combination and selection
- Cross-validation with ensemble methods
- Texture synthesis and analysis
- Real-time texture classification

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Expected Results
- High accuracy texture classification (>90%)
- Feature importance analysis
- Robust performance across texture types
- Real-time classification capabilities

## Applications
- Material quality inspection
- Medical image diagnosis
- Fabric and textile analysis
- Surface defect detection
