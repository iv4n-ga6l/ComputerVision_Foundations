# Classical Machine Learning

## Overview
Classical machine learning techniques form the foundation of computer vision before deep learning. Understanding these methods is crucial for grasping the evolution of computer vision algorithms and knowing when to apply traditional approaches.

## Concepts :
- Supervised learning (Regression, SVM, kNN, Decision Trees)
- Unsupervised learning (k-Means, PCA, DBSCAN)
- Feature extraction (HOG, LBP, GLCM)
- Image classification using classical methods
- Dimensionality reduction and clustering
- Ensemble methods for computer vision

## Projects :
- [Project 1: kNN Digit Recognition](Project%201/README.md) - Train a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for MNIST digits
- [Project 2: SVM Image Classification with HOG](Project%202/README.md) - Object classification using Support Vector Machines
- [Project 3: PCA Face Recognition](Project%203/README.md) - Eigenfaces for face recognition using Principal Component Analysis
- [Project 4: K-Means Image Segmentation](Project%204/README.md) - Unsupervised image segmentation using clustering
- [Project 5: Random Forest Texture Classification](Project%205/README.md) - Texture analysis using ensemble methods
